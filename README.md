# Graphics

Hey! This is Mau and the work that I've developed for second partial of Graphics 2D course for 6th semester at the university. 
I share my project and practices to easy the load of work for you. 

Please, try to do the practices by your own :) 

I also clearly understand that this is a pretty difficult course, so that's why you could take by reference my code.

If you found the repo helpful to you, pleaseee leave a star, follow me or just say thanks!

You got this!

With love,
Mau!
